Trello was used for project management. User stories were created on the Miro board and tasks were created based on it. The team then discussed the work they would be comfortable with and tasks were distributed and assigned based on each member's capability. Throughout the project, the Miro board was open for any additional ideas any member would have, then it would be reviewed as a team.
